 * A stored file is classified as:
 *   - "deleted"      — `stat()` returns ENOENT or ENOTDIR. Its nodes will
 *                       be purged and its hash row dropped.
 *   - "mode-skipped" — `stat()` succeeds. The file exists on disk but the
 *                       current discovery pass didn't visit it (e.g. excluded
 *                       by FAST_SKIP_DIRS in fast/moderate mode). Its nodes
 *                       must be preserved AND its hash row must be carried
 *                       forward into the new DB so subsequent reindexes can
 *                       still see it as "known" rather than treating it as
 *                       new-or-deleted.
 *
 * Without this distinction, a fast-mode reindex after a full-mode index
 * would silently purge every file under `tools/`, `scripts/`, `bin/`,
 * `build/`, `docs/`, `__tests__/`, etc. — see task
 * claude-connectors/codebase-memory-index-repository-is-destructive-...
 * and the 2026-04-13 Skyline incident (packages/mcp/src/tools/ vanished
 * from a live graph mid-session).
 *
 * Mode-skipped hash preservation is the second half of the additive-merge
 * contract: dump_and_persist re-upserts these hash rows so the next reindex
 * can correctly detect a real on-disk deletion of a mode-skipped file (as
 * opposed to seeing it as "never existed" → noop → orphaned graph nodes).
 *
 * Fail-safe rules (preserve nodes on uncertainty):
 *   - repo_path NULL → log error and preserve everything (return 0
 *     deletions, empty mode_skipped). The caller contract is that
 *     repo_path is required; a NULL means a misconfigured pipeline,
 *     not a deletion signal.
 *   - snprintf truncation (combined path ≥ CBM_SZ_4K) → preserve. We can't
 *     reliably stat a truncated path. Treat as mode-skipped.
 *   - stat() errno != ENOENT/ENOTDIR (EACCES, EIO, ELOOP, transient NFS,
 *     etc.) → preserve. The file may exist; we just can't see it right now.
 *     Treat as mode-skipped.
 *
 * Note: we use stat() (not lstat()) on purpose. A symlink whose target was
 * deleted should be classified as deleted from the indexer's perspective
 * because the indexer follows symlinks during discovery — a stale symlink
 * has no source to parse. */

/* ── Inbound cross-file edge preservation (incremental correctness) ──
 *
 * The purge step (cbm_gbuf_delete_by_file) removes a changed file's nodes,
 * and the cascade then drops every edge referencing them — INCLUDING inbound
 * edges whose source lives in an UNCHANGED file (e.g. StudyService.grade ->
 * SM2.review, or a Folder -> File containment edge). Because incremental only
 * re-parses the changed files, the resolution passes never regenerate those
 * inbound edges, so the graph silently loses cross-file CALLS / USAGE /
 * CONTAINS_FILE / INHERITS / ... edges on every edit and diverges from a
 * clean full reindex (which resolves every file).
 *
 * Fix: snapshot the inbound cross-file edges into changed files BEFORE the
 * purge, keyed by endpoint qualified_name (stable across re-parse), then
 * re-link them AFTER re-resolution + post-passes. Notes:
 *   - Only edges whose target is in a changed file and whose source is NOT
 *     are snapshotted; edges out of a changed file are regenerated when that
 *     file is re-resolved.
 *   - Edge types recomputed wholesale by post-passes (SIMILAR_TO,
 *     SEMANTICALLY_RELATED) are skipped — re-linking a stale snapshot could
 *     add edges a full reindex would not produce.
 *   - cbm_gbuf_insert_edge dedups, so re-linking an edge the resolver already
 *     recreated is a harmless no-op.
 *   - A target whose qualified_name no longer exists (symbol deleted or
 *     renamed by the edit) is dropped — matching full-reindex semantics. */
